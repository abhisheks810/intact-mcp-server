# Agent Run: routing-tiles-agent

Created: 2026-05-14T19:20:20.810459Z
Agent: routing-tiles-agent
Automation: intact-agent-runner-launchd-map-platform
Product: map-platform
Status: completed_with_blockers
Next recommended agent: routing-tiles-agent

## Summary

Add a small backend routing health endpoint under /route/health that reports configured provider, candidate router targets, and lightweight readiness/fallback metadata without changing routing behavior. Extend route contract tests to cover the new health contract. This aligns with routing reliability and the agent metric that health checks are defined.

- No finalization attempted because no verified patch was applied.

## Deferred

- Add active upstream probing to /route/health only after approval, since live network checks would increase endpoint latency and complexity.
- Document the new /route/health endpoint in routing/development docs in a follow-up if this contract is accepted.
